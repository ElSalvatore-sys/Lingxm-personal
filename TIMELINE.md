## Risk Management

### High Risk Items

**Risk 1: Content Generation Delays**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Buffer days built into timeline, can reduce sentence count to 2/word instead of 3
- **Contingency:** Prioritize English + Spanish, defer other languages to post-launch

**Risk 2: Quality Below 95%**
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Daily quality checks, sample validation every 100 sentences
- **Contingency:** Regenerate low-quality batches immediately

**Risk 3: Integration Issues**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Daily integration testing, merge parent branch daily
- **Contingency:** Additional testing day in Week 4

**Risk 4: Terminal Resource Constraints**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Cloud-based terminals, can scale up/down as needed
- **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 3-5 days if needed
