## Part 5: Generation Process

### Recommended Workflow

```
For each language and CEFR level:

1. EXTRACT official CEFR list (if available)
   └─> Cambridge/Goethe/DELF lists

2. CROSS-REFERENCE with corpus frequency
   └─> COCA/DWDS/Lexique data
   └─> Keep only words in top N by level

3. FILTER by frequency rank:
   A1: Top 500 most frequent
   A2: Rank 501-1,500
   B1: Rank 1,501-3,000
   B2: Rank 3,001-5,000
   C1: Rank 5,001-8,000
   C2: Rank 8,001-12,000

4. ADD domain-specific terms (B1+ only)
   └─> Gastronomy, IT, Business, Medical

5. VALIDATE i+1 compatibility
   └─> Can this word be used in sentences at this CEFR level?
   └─> Does it require C2 grammar at B1 level? → Remove

6. GENERATE full entries using AI
   └─> Translations
   └─> Explanations
   └─> Example sentences
   └─> Conjugations (if verb)

7. QUALITY CONTROL
   └─> Native speaker review
   └─> TTS pronunciation check
   └─> Sentence validation
```

### Quality Control Checklist

- ✅ Word exists in frequency source (rank verified)
- ✅ CEFR level matches official classification
- ✅ Translations accurate in both languages
- ✅ Explanations clear and level-appropriate
- ✅ Examples use i+1 grammar (current level + 1)
- ✅ Conjugations complete for verbs
- ✅ TTS pronunciation natural
- ✅ No offensive or inappropriate content

## Conclusion

Our analysis of 4,140 existing words revealed clear success patterns: frequency-based ordering, concrete-to-abstract progression, thematic clustering, and complete data structures. By applying these principles systematically across all languages using validated CEFR and corpus frequency sources, we can scale to 22,000+ high-quality vocabulary entries that provide complete A1-C2 coverage with specialized domain tracks.

The hybrid multi-source approach (CEFR official lists + corpus frequency + domain vocabularies) ensures both pedagogical validity and real-world relevance. AI-powered generation with strict quality control will maintain the high standards demonstrated in our best existing files while scaling efficiently.
